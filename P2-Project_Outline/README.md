## Submission Instructions

### Overview
With social distancing, we (my wife and I) have been cooking at home even more than before. We like to keep track of the recipes we have made, and also keep track of any modifications we make, since we usually blend more than one recipe together together or make substitutions on the fly depending on how we think a dish is going. Forked/Remixed Recipes app will allow users to save versions of recipes they have tried, while keep track of the original version. The should be able to search through a library of recipes, fork recipes, and rate and favorite recipes.
### Features
- **Search** Search through recipe library
- **User account** Create a user account. When user is logged in, they can see any favorited or forked recipes
- **Fork recipes** User can create a new version of a recipe
- **Create new recipes** If a recipe is not in the library, a user should be able to create one


### Technologies
- ASP.NET MVC for framework
- PostgreSQL for data
- Bootstrap for styling

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to work with a public recipe API to populate a base library of recipes to start from. Also, dockerizing a db to work with the app too.
